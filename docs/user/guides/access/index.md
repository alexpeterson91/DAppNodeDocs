title: Accessing your Dappnode
---
---
This section covers different ways of accessing your Dappnode.  

We recommend that you start by setting up basic access via [WiFi](wifi) (_recommended!_) or the [local proxy method](local) (_this method only offers a highly restricted Dappnode UI, and is not designed to be used beyond the initial setup_). 

> :warning: **Once you have your Dappnode set up and configured; you will want to access your Dappnode on the go (outside of your local network), we strongly suggest that you take a look at the [VPN](vpn) setup guides.** 
>
> **We highly recommend that you use the Wireguard VPN package to access your Dappnode, as this is by far the most secure and user-friendly option.**
