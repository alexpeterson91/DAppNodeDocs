If you have bought a Dappnode from our store or you installed Dappnode in a physical device with a Wi-Fi chip inside, you can directly connect to your DAppNodes UI by connecting your client device to the Dappnode's Wi-Fi hotspot.

_If you did not purchase your hardware from us there is a possibility the built in Wi-Fi card may not be recognized by the OS on install and will need to be activated manually, this varies greatly depending on what hardware is used if you encounter an issue please reach out to support on [Discord!](https://discord.gg/dappnode/)_
